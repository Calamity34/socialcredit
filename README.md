## How to run your own instance?

0. **do not remove the mentions of original creators**.

1. You will need to create an empty **credit.json** file in the root folder of the bot.

Just in case: fill it like this:
```json
{
    
}
```

*in case of updating the bot: backup the credit.json file using `sc.backup`, then copy it back from `backup/timedate/credit.json`*

2. You will need to create a **token.json** file in the root folder of the bot.

The file should look like this:
```json
{
    "vendor.token": "BOT TOKEN GOES HERE"
}
```

3. Go to **env.json** and make sure that the bot type is set to `release` to not have debug logs in the console.

4. Just launch the bot using `~$ python bot.py`

Our bot has an advanced logging system, so it's gonna tell you in case anything goes wrong.

You should be up and running at this point!
